### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a lot of stuff! From Kernel development on Linux and on different Architectures, to write tech blogs, to enjoy coding random stuff, improve my personal automation and more.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning (yup funny choice of words, I know!) to apply it to Cyber Security and a bunch of other stuff
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on whatver, as long as it has a "C" involved (C, C++, C#), maybe an "A" (ASM) or an "R" (Rust). You'll find me mostly on the [RISC OS Community](https://github.com/RISC-OS-Community) or on my [ZFP Systems](https://github.com/ZFPSystems) organisations.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finishing my many many projects!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Assembly, c'mon I know you want to know more about it!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://paolozaino.wordpress.com/contact/
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Apparently, the first computer virus was created in 1986, the same year I started coding. Now, before you jump to conclusions, I wasn't involved at all, I swear! ðŸ˜„

Check out my blog if you want to read some of my tutorials and more (Linux, macOS, BSD, RISC OS, Retrocoding and Retrocomputing... oh and some security stuff too!): https://paolozaino.wordpress.com/
